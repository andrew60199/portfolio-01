                            <p>My name is Andrew Beissmann and welcome to my software portfolio. Known on GitHub as AND.evv, which is a pseudonym that arranges my legal name it include the abbreviation Dev.</p>
                            <p>I completed an Industrial Design degree in 2021 and I&rsquo;m currently working toward incorporating Full Stack Development into my skillset.</p>
                            <p>Check out some of my project below and reach out if you&rsquo;d like to collaborate!</p>

                                <h3>Cityspire</h3>
                                <p>For my most recent project I worked in a team of three to develop a city inspiration application. When you enter the site you are presented with three random cities which you can click to review. In addition to the search bar and featured destinations our goal was to allow users to find their dream location and read up on the place ahead of time.</p>
                                <p>I was responsible for finalising the wireframe after every team member had their say in what the design could be. With my newly acquired Javascript skills I was able to link the Google Maps and Wikipedia API's seen after a location has been selected. </p>
                                <p>These elements working together beautifully and allow the user to read the first 1200 characters of it's respective Wikipedia article while visualising it Google's powerful map.</p>
                                <p>I wasn't able to achieve such a refined application on my own and everything else you see on the page was created by my wonderful team members Jeffery and Laura, again thank you both! It was a pleasure working with you both.</p>

                                <p>Tasked with some code refactoring, this attempt has helped develop my skills towards becoming a full stack developer. The code needed a little work, I had to fix the HTML semantics and add in alternative text to improve accessiblity. It was also a fresher in the GitHub version control workflow.</p>

                                <p>In preparation to learn Full Stack Development through a coding bootcamp, the students were tasked with making a study guide.</p>

                                <p>In addition to enrolling in the coding bootcamp course I have also been completing Codecademy&rsquo;s Pro Career Path &lsquo;Front-End Engineer&rsquo;. The task required reading through documentation and debugging the files. Doing so was a valuable learning experience.</p>
